## What is Senuti?  

**Senuti** is a powerful yet simple **music recovery and transfer application** that enables users to move songs, playlists, and media from an iPod, iPhone, or iPad directly back to a computer. Designed for users who need to rebuild or restore their iTunes libraries, it serves as a seamless bridge between iOS devices and desktop music collections.  

Created by **Whitney Young**, Senuti was developed to solve a common problem: retrieving music from devices after accidental library loss or hardware changes. With an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, users can browse, preview, and transfer selected tracks or full playlists in minutes — all without complex setup or sync conflicts.  

Senuti preserves **metadata, album art, and play counts**, ensuring that transferred songs retain all original details. It’s particularly useful for migrating content to a new Mac, sharing libraries between computers, or creating backups before syncing with iTunes.  

Built for reliability and simplicity, Senuti works efficiently with both legacy and modern Apple devices. It gives you total control over your music library, allowing flexible export and transfer options without overwriting existing collections.
